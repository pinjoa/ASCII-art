# ASCII information

I'm initiating a comprehensive repository that will serve as a central hub for all things related to **[ASCII](://pinjoa.github.io/ascii-related/full-ascii-table.html)** (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). This universal character encoding standard has a wide range of applications, even in today's technologically advanced world.

Here are some of the key areas where **[ASCII](://pinjoa.github.io/ascii-related/full-ascii-table.html)** is still prominently used:

- **Markdown**: **[ASCII](://pinjoa.github.io/ascii-related/full-ascii-table.html)** characters are the backbone of Markdown language. It's a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. From headers, links, to lists, **[ASCII](://pinjoa.github.io/ascii-related/full-ascii-table.html)** characters enable all these features in Markdown (you can learn more **[here](://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)**).

- **Terminal or Command Line Interface (CLI) Software**: **[ASCII](://pinjoa.github.io/ascii-related/full-ascii-table.html)** is essential in the development of software that operates within a terminal or command line interface. It's used to interpret command inputs and display outputs, making it integral to the functionality of CLIs.

- **Programming and Web Development**: **[ASCII](://pinjoa.github.io/ascii-related/full-ascii-table.html)** characters represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices that use text. Most modern character-encoding schemes, which support many more characters, are based on **[ASCII](://pinjoa.github.io/ascii-related/full-ascii-table.html)**.

- **Data Communication**: **[ASCII](://pinjoa.github.io/ascii-related/full-ascii-table.html)** is also used in data communications, representing text-based data transmitted over networks, including the internet.

- **Art and Design**: **[ASCII](://pinjoa.github.io/ascii-related/full-ascii-table.html)** art is a graphic design technique that uses printable characters defined by the ASCII standard to create images and designs.

This repository aims to delve into these applications and more, providing a comprehensive understanding of **[ASCII](://pinjoa.github.io/ascii-related/full-ascii-table.html)'s** role and significance in our digital world.
